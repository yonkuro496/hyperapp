HyperApp — Trading dashboard to spot Hyperliquid “whales” at a glance 🐳⚡

HyperApp visualizes key trading signals on Hyperliquid in a highly intuitive way.
From public transactions, it extracts flows by extra-large / large / medium / small trade sizes and lets you grasp buy/sell imbalance and whale positioning at a glance.

🧭 Anyone can understand where the weight is right now in seconds—and make better decisions.

✨ Features
	•	🐳 Instant whale tracking: Real-time aggregation by size (XL/L/M/S)
	•	🟥🟩 Buy/Sell balance visualization: Colors and layout for immediate intuition
	•	⚡ Responsive & lightweight: Smooth on desktop and mobile
	•	📈 Dashboard-first: Minimal layout focused on “what’s happening now”

We turn hard-to-read public data into actionable trading context.

🧪 Use Cases
	•	Instantly check “Which side have XL trades favored in the last 5 minutes?”
	•	Use as confirmation for headwinds/tailwinds before entering new positions
	•	Cross-check flow at pivotal moments (breakouts/fake-outs)

🛠 How It Works (Overview)
	1.	Subscribe to Hyperliquid public transactions
	2.	Classify by trade size: extra-large / large / medium / small
	3.	Aggregate buys/sells and reflect imbalance & momentum on the dashboard

Currently based solely on public data. No private data is used.
